                            <h2>Authentic and delicious</h2>
                            <p>We ate out every night in our recent week in Cavtat and Konoba Kolona was the best experience. You don't get a harbour view but then you don't get hassled to enter and you do get authentic really fresh fish and meat cooked beautifully in Croatian style with little fuss and a touch of 'home cooking' feeling. It is just one street from the sea (near the bus station) but has a pleasant dining room and lovely roof terrace. Service was attentive and friendly and knowledgeable about what was going on in the kitchen. On two visits we had a mixture of mixed fish which was probably the star of the show - tasting 'caught same-day' fresh and served with beautifully homely potatoes and spinach. We had previously had fish kebabs which were also wonderfully fresh and cleverly cooked so the fish of all sorts were perfectly cooked, nothing under or over. Starters of octopus salad and Dalmatian smoked ham with aragula (rocket) were just right. Neighbouring tables having meat seemed equally pleased. Next time we visit Cavtat this will be our first port of call to eat.</p>

                            <p>We decided to have dinner at this Konoba based on the numerousgreat TA reviews, and it was sensational! I wasn't that hungry so I opted for two starters, the lobster salad & the shrimp tempura. Both were outstanding, the lobster was a very generous portion super fresh & delicious, the tempura perfectly crispy & tender shrimp. My boyfriend had the starter seafood combo of clams, mussels, scampi prepared Buzara style, which he thought was great. He then had another seafood offering of raznjic, another 10! Our friend started with the seafood soup & then had a delicious plat of John Dory fish with tasty vegetables. The service was excellent as well! There are many restaurants in Cavtat, this one is not to be missed!! Very highly recommended.</p>

                            <p>We had a delicious meal on our first visit this evening. My husband chose the fresh tuna and I went for the swordfish..both of which according to our lovely waitress, Neda were caught by the owner so very fresh.We were not disappointed! Can also recommend the squash soup and fish soup as starters and the panna cotta dessert..Good white house wine too. Lovely, unpretentious restaurant set back from the waterfront. Will definitely revisit and would recommend.Thank you, Neda, chef and everyone.</p>

                            <p>Spent a week in Cavtat at the beginning of this month and the town it’s self is beautiful and Croatia too but overall we found the food very expensive and not that nice. On our last night our Kayak guide suggested we go to Konoba Kolona so we took his advice and we were very grateful we did. The food was fresh and everything was amazing, we were a party of 8 including a four year old and every one of us enjoyed our meal. At the end of the evening there was not one thing left on our plates which was a change from the other nights when we couldn’t even eat the food we ordered as it was so bad. The staff too were fantastic and best of all it was about the same price we had been paying all week, the only thing we regret is that we didn’t find it on our first night there.</p>
